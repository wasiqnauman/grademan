# ðŸ§™Grademan

Grademan is a program that will update the students on their performance during the semester.

As a TA one of the most frequent questions I get asked repeatedly is if a submission for a lab assignment was received or not and what are the grades for the rest of the labs.
This solves that problem by periodically checking the grades and emails the students about what labs have been received and what was the grade.

what needs to be done:
 1. Finalize a template for the email message.
