# ðŸ§™Grademan

Grademan is a program that updates the students on their performance during the semester.

As a TA one of the most frequent questions I get asked is if a submission was received or not and what are the grades for the rest of the labs.
This solves that problem by periodically checking the grades and emails the students about what labs have been received and what was the grade.
